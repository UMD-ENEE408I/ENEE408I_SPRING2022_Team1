# Introduction

Upload the code in `send_double_sketch` to the Arduino. It produces random numbers (doubles) and writes them to the  serial port. Note the port you are using - you'll need this. My Arduino is on Xavier port /dev/ttyUSB0

Run `python3 CheckSerialComm.py`. Check that the port is correct if you had to change it above.

Final result will be a simple plot:
